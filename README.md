To get a discord token, go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. Then, go to the bot tab and create a bot. You can then copy the token and paste it into the `Config.json` file. Also do not forget to enable all the Privileged Gateway Intents  

Register for the FTC API [FTC Events API](https://ftc-events.firstinspires.org/services/API)     

To get a NASA API key, go to the [NASA API Portal](https://api.nasa.gov/) and create a new application. You can then copy the token and paste it into the `Config.json` file  

If you need to test the AI command, you can get a GitBook token by going to the [GitBook Developer Portal](https://app.gitbook.com/account/developer)  

To get a Google Maps token, go to the [Google Maps Developer Portal](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and create a new application. You can then copy the token and paste it into the `Config.json` file  

It is not required to run with a Google Maps token as it only uses the google maps api if the normal geocoding fails
